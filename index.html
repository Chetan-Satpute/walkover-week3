            <h2>Minecraft</h2>
            <p>
              Minecraft is a sandbox video game developed by the Swedish video
              game developer Mojang Studios. The game was created by Markus
              "Notch" Persson in the Java programming language. Following
              several early private testing versions, it was first made public
              in May 2009 before fully releasing in November 2011, with Jens
              Bergensten then taking over development. Minecraft has since been
              ported to several other platforms and is the best-selling video
              game of all time, with over 200 million copies sold and over 140
              million monthly active users as of 2021.
